Presentation
------------

Flow is a flexible engine which allows to create various "coverflow", carousel and other types to display pictures.  
Writing the engine of a jQuery display plugin is often 90% of the job, and the css manages the rest. Flow is designed to allow you to create your own display by focusing on the css management.  
Since it is a pure engine, it does not embeed any display plugin however we have added some examples plugins in the package.  
Have a look on the examples plugins of Flow and be creative enough to display your own pictures the way you want.  
Flow also embed a picture loader for a better user experience.  
Flow is compatible with all main browsers (ie7+, firefox, chrome, safari...)
